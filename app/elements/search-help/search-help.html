        <div>
          DIG will search for results that contain at least one of the entered keywords.  Results that contain multiple keywords or more instances of a keyword are ranked higher in the search result list.
        </div>
        <div>
          Searches ignore punctuation (except when <span>Advanced Search Mode</span> is enabled as detailed below) and treat text separated by punctuation as separate keywords (for example, a search for the text <span>123-456-7890</span> is separated into the three keyword search for <span>123 456 7890</span>).
        </div>
        <div>
          Searches that contain the word <span>AND</span> (all uppercase) between keywords return results that contain both of the surrounding keywords (for example, a search for <span>red AND blue AND green</span> only returns results that contain all three words).
        </div>
        <div>
          Searches that contain the word <span>NOT</span> (all uppercase) preceeding a keyword return results that do not contain the keyword.
        </div>
        <div>
          Searches that contain the word <span>AND</span> or <span>OR</span> (all uppercase) without both preceeding and following keywords (for example, <span>OR red</span> or <span>blue AND</span>) or the word <span>NOT</span> without a following keyword will return an <span>error</span>.
        </div>
        <div>
          The following options are available in <span>Advanced Search Mode</span> (which can be enabled through the navigation bar or user preferences):
          <ul>
            <li>
              Parentheses allow keywords to be grouped within a search (for example, a search for <span>(red AND blue) OR (green AND yellow)</span> returns results that contain either both the words <span>red</span> and <span>blue</span> or both the words <span>green</span> and <span>yellow</span>).  Searches that contain incorrect or unpaired parentheses will return an <span>error</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches for keywords that are surrounded by quotation marks (<span>"</span>) return results that contain the exact phrase(s) within each pair of quotation marks in the same order.  Searches that contain an uneven number of quotation marks will return an <span>error</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches for a keyword containing a question mark (<span>?</span>) return results that match the keyword by replacing the question mark with any other single character (for example, a search for <span>r?d</span> matches results that contain <span>rad</span>, <span>red</span>, <span>rid</span>, etc.).  Searches for a keyword containing an asterisk (<span>*</span>) return results that match the keyword by replacing the asterisk with any number of characters (for example, a search for <span>r*d</span> matches results that contain <span>red</span>, <span>read</span>, <span>ranked</span>, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches that contain a set of forward slashes (<span>/</span>) treat the text between the two slashes as a regular expression.  Searches that contain incorrect regular expressions will return an <span>error</span>.  For more information on the supported regular expression syntax, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-regexp-query.html#regexp-syntax" target="_blank">please refer to this page</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches for a keyword containing a tilde (<span>~</span>) return results that contain words similar to that keyword (for example, a search for <span>rde~</span> matches results that contain <span>red</span>, <span>read</span>, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches for a keyword containing a caret (<span>^</span>) followed by a number (for example, <span>red^2</span>) rank that keyword more highly than other keywords in the search result list.  Searches that contain a caret that is not preceeded by a keyword or followed by a number will return an <span>error</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Searches for a keyword preceeded by a plus (<span>+</span>) sign (for example, <span>red +fox</span>) require all results to contain that keyword; other keywords not preceeded by a plus sign are optional.  Searches for a keyword preceeded by a minus (<span>-</span>) sign require all results to not contain that keyword.  Searches that contain a plus or minus sign that is not followed by a keyword will return an <span>error</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Characters used in the special search syntax must be preceeded by a backslash (\) in order to be included in a keyword (for example, in order to search for <span>(1+1)=2</span> you must enter <span>\(1\+1\)\=2</span>).  Searches that contain a backslash that is not followed by a character will return an <span>error</span>.  This includes the following characters:
              <div>
                <span>
                  + - = & | > < ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /
                </span>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
